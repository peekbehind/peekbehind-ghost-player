PeekBehind Ghost Player shows the mouse cursors of your latest users
as ghosts layered on top of each page of your web site.

FIRST STEPS
-----------

Run the unit tests by opening the files in the *tests/* folder
and read the source code and comments to get familiar with the
implementation in the *code/* folder.

You can then customize the implementation, for example replacing
the mouse cursor and other graphics displayed during replay with
your own graphics.
